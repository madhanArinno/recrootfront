            Recroot is the result of a dynamic and young team. We struggled to
            get the right IT professionals at affordable costs for our start-up.
            After consulting with many entrepreneurs, we realised that IT skill
            shortage is hampering most organisations across the world. Recroot
            was developed as a platform for organisations to hire skilled,
            active, dynamic freshers or experienced IT professionals at
            affordable rates. Unlike traditional recruitment companies, we
            strive to provide a platform that businesses of all types, sizes and
            from every sector can leverage and gain value.
